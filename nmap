21/tcp - FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
Used to transfer files.
Risk: FTP transmits data (including passwords) in plain text, so it’s vulnerable to eavesdropping and credential theft.
Consequence: Attackers can capture login info or upload malicious files if access isn’t secured.

53/tcp - DNS (Domain Name System)
Resolves domain names to IPs.
Risk: Open DNS servers can be abused for DNS amplification attacks (a type of DDoS).
Consequence: Can be used as a tool for attacks or leak internal info.

80/tcp - HTTP (Web Server)
What it is: Standard unencrypted web traffic.
Risk: If misconfigured, vulnerable to web attacks (XSS, SQL injection, etc.).
Consequence: Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities to compromise the server.


443/tcp - HTTPS (Secure Web Traffic)
Secure web server (encrypted).
Risk: Usually safer than HTTP but vulnerable if SSL/TLS config is weak.
Consequence: Sensitive data could be intercepted if misconfigured.


1119/tcp - Bnetgame
Blizzard game service port.
Risk: Typically used for gaming, less commonly targeted but could expose system info.
Consequence: Possible exploitation if service has vulnerabilities.
